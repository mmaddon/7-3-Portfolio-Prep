        These two apps required both Android Studio, which facilitated design with attributes given and the capability of code to be implemented in its completion. The User needs addressed were for registering, login, SMS messaging, and keeping track of aiming towards a specific goal of weight.   

       This application required three screens.  One for registering, then the login, and then the recording section to keep track of the user's weight goals.  The features were very simple, so that the majority of age groups could utilize this application.  There were a few notes taken throughout the coding of the app to explain what was going on, however, they were simple as well.  There was no need to complicate the code notes so that it would be confusing for other users to read from.  The designs were successful only because they didn't over-compensate the user in getting distracted.

       The process of coding each app was utilizing design and then going back and making changes in the code.  Thankfully, Android Studio is like a lot of other IDE's that can help the user know what code goes next and help to expedite the whole process. All these things will be applied in the future for any given project because for any given rookie they truly are a necessity.  

       There were times that the program was run by using the run function but there were also times that the rebuild function was necessary as well.  Some errors showed after a run, but there were times that these errors were not applicatory to the app.  Therefore after the rebuild function was finished, the app ran normally when the play button was utilized one more time. Rebuild helps to clean the app, which thankfully can reexamine the end result.   

       There were originally supposed to be delete buttons as in the first prototype.  However learning how to delete numbers is still a thing that is being accomplished.  Therefore the possible delete coding was removed, and buttons just had textview that stated "YOU CAN DO IT!"  Therefore the buttons did have some use after all in aesthetics of the project.  

       This app was difficult because of the absolute inexperience of its undertaking.  There really was not a huge amount of success due to the fact that this app could be done better.  However, for the time, this is not the worst that could have been done.  This has been a very good learning experience and there is hope for more complete models in the future.
